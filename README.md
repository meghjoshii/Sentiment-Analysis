# Sentiment-Analysis
With the availability of a massive volume of online review data, sentiment analysis plays a significant role. Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing and text analysis to systematically identify and classify subjective information. The main purpose of this project is to build a classifier to determine whether a review  is associated with a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Additionally, the model can be used to determine words that are most strongly associated with the positive or negative reviews.
